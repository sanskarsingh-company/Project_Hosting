 Introduction

 This project is designed to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure for a scalable, resilient, and highly available environment. The repository includes:

 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning cloud resources.
 Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines.
 Configuration management and container orchestration.
 The infrastructure supports multiple environments (development, staging, production), and the setup is automated using Terraform and Kubernetes.

 Technologies Used

 Cloud Provider: AWS / GCP / Azure
 Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform / CloudFormation
 Containerization: Docker
 Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
 Configuration Management: Ansible / Helm
 CI/CD: Jenkins / GitLab CI / GitHub Actions / CircleCI
 Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
 Load Balancing: Nginx / AWS ELB / Traefik
 Secrets Management: HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager
 Version Control: Git
 Architecture Overview

 Provide a high-level diagram or explanation of your infrastructure architecture. Mention key components:

 Load Balancers for handling traffic.
 Kubernetes Cluster for container orchestration.
 CI/CD Pipeline to automate testing and deployments.
 Monitoring and Logging for infrastructure health.
 Auto-scaling to handle dynamic loads.
 Example:

 User --> Load Balancer --> Kubernetes Cluster --> App Pods --> Database
          |
    CI/CD Pipeline --> Automated Deployment
          |
      Monitoring/Logging --> Prometheus/Grafana/ELK
 Infrastructure Setup

 Prerequisites
 Ensure the following are installed:

 Terraform: Install Guide
 Docker: Install Guide
 kubectl: Install Guide
 Helm: Install Guide
 Steps to Provision Infrastructure
 Clone the repository:
 git clone git@github.com:username/devops-project-hosting.git
 cd devops-project-hosting
 Configure cloud provider credentials (e.g., AWS):
 export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
 export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
 Terraform Initialization:
 cd terraform/
 terraform init
 terraform apply
 Setup Kubernetes Cluster (for AWS EKS/GCP GKE/Azure AKS):
 aws eks --region region-name update-kubeconfig --name cluster-name
 Configuration

 Environment Variables:
 ENV: Define the environment (development, staging, production).
 DB_PASSWORD: Store the database password using a secrets manager.
 Configuration Files:
 .env: Store all environment-specific variables here.
 config.yaml: Kubernetes or application configurations.
 Secrets Management: Use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to securely store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
 Deployment

 Docker: Build and push the Docker image:
 docker build -t your-image-name .
 docker push your-image-name
 Kubernetes Deployment: Use kubectl or Helm to deploy the application:
 kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
 CI/CD Pipeline: The CI/CD pipeline is set up to automatically test and deploy your application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
 CI/CD Pipeline

 The project uses [CI/CD tool] to automate:

 Continuous Integration: Runs automated tests on every pull request.
 Continuous Deployment: Deploys to the Kubernetes cluster automatically on successful tests.
 Pipeline configuration can be found in .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, or .github/workflows.

 Monitoring and Logging

 Prometheus and Grafana: Prometheus collects metrics, while Grafana visualizes them. You can set up Grafana dashboards to monitor:
 CPU/Memory usage.
 Number of running pods.
 HTTP request rates, errors, etc.
 ELK Stack: Set up Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for centralized logging.
 Logstash aggregates logs from the application.
 Elasticsearch stores the logs.
 Kibana provides a user interface for log analysis.
 Contributing

 We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps:

 Fork the repository.
 Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
 Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add new feature').
 Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
 Create a pull request.
 Please make sure your code passes the CI tests before submitting a pull request.
